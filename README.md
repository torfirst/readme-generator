Clone the repo and install the inquirer package by typing in "npm install inquirer@8.2.4" in the terminal. Inquirer 8.2.4 is required for this project to work.

## Usage
Users can simply enter "node index.js" in their terminal and answer the prompts. Once all prompts are answered, a README.md file will be created with their answers.
